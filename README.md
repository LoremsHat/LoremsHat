Hi all! You can call me by my nickname if you want. If you need me, write me an email. Usually the answer comes within a few days. I've loved programming my whole life, but my progress has slowed down too much. In order to speed up development, I will post my code here for criticism (or on my Git server). If you want to give me advice, please email me!
